# ReachInBox Assignment

## Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure that you have the following installed on your local machine:

- **Node.js** (v14 or above): You can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm** (v6 or above): npm comes with Node.js, so you should have it after installing Node.js. If you prefer **yarn**, you can install it globally using:

  ```bash
  npm install --global yarn
  ```

### 2. Clone the Repository

To get started, you need to clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```

This command will create a directory with the name of your repository and download all the files to your local machine.

### 3. Navigate to the Project Directory

After cloning the repository, move into the project directory by running:

```bash
cd your-repo-name
```

This command sets your terminal's working directory to the project folder.

### 4. Install Dependencies

Next, install all the project dependencies. You can use either npm or yarn for this step.

Using **npm**:

```bash
npm install
```

Or, if you're using **yarn**:

```bash
yarn install
```

This will download and install all the necessary packages defined in the `package.json` file.

### 5. Start the Development Server

To view the project in your web browser, start the development server. This will host your project on a local server.

Using **npm**:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or, if you're using **yarn**:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Once the server starts, you should see a message in the terminal indicating that the project is running, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.

### 6. View the Web Page

Open your web browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

You should now see your web page displayed in the browser. Any changes you make in the source code will automatically reflect here.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during setup or while running the project, consider the following:

- Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly.
- Check if the port `5173` is free, or configure the server to run on a different port by modifying the `vite.config.js` file.
- Review error messages in the terminal for clues, and refer to the Vite or React documentation for solutions.

### Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to this project, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
6. Open a Pull Request.
